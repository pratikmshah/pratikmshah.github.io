When I was learning technical analysis I remember just focusing on the daily charts and ignoring other timeframes. Furthermore, I would just be looking at the series of candles to find a bullish engulfing, morning star, or piercing candle just to name a few without actually looking at the bigger picture. I ended up bag holding a lot and not realizing I was buying near the top of the current trend; or the distribution phase as it is called. I picked up a book called "Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes" by Brian Shannon, from Amazon, and although it was pricey it explained the different phases for a stock. In addition, he also explains the psychology of what is happening with the market participants during each stage and why the price action is as it is. In this article I will be using Nutanix(NTNX), a stock I'm currently bag holding as of 7.28.19, to explain the phases of the stock.

#### Stage 1: Accumulation

This stage occurs after prices drop from a much higher level. It its the phase in which the buyers push back against seller to regain control of the stock and prevent it form falling any further.

In the early transition stage from declining to neutral the longer term moving averages are still declining. The stock will cross above and below the averages; once they catch up.

In the middle part of the accumulation stage buyers will hold a floor on the price and accumulate; however, there is no momentum to propel the stock.

The later/last phase of the accumulation stage buyers start buying up the stock making new higher lows on the price but sellers prevent the resistance level from being broken. The moving averages will become flat.

#### Stage 2: Markup

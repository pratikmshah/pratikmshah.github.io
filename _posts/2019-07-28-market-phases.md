When I was learning technical analysis I remember just focusing on the daily charts and ignoring other timeframes. Furthermore, I would just be looking at the series of candles to find a bullish engulfing, morning star, or piercing candle just to name a few without actually looking at the bigger picture. I ended up bag holding a lot and not realizing I was buying near the top of the current trend; or the distribution phase as it is called. I picked up a book called "Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes" by Brian Shannon, from Amazon, and although it was pricey it explained the different phases for a stock. In addition, he also explains the psychology of what is happening with the market participants during each stage and why the price action is as it is. In this article I will be using Nutanix(NTNX), a stock I'm currently bag holding as of 7.28.19, to explain the phases of the stock.

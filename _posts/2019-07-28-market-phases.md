When I was learning technical analysis I remember just focusing on the daily charts and ignoring other timeframes. Furthermore, I would just be looking at the series of candles to find a bullish engulfing, morning star, or piercing candle just to name a few without actually looking at the bigger picture. I ended up bag holding a lot and not realizing I was buying near the top of the current trend; or the distribution phase as it is called. I picked up a book called "Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes" by Brian Shannon, from Amazon, and although it was pricey it explained the different phases for a stock. In addition, he also explains the psychology of what is happening with the market participants during each stage and why the price action is as it is. In this article I will be using Nutanix(NTNX), a stock I'm currently bag holding as of 7.28.19, to explain the phases of the stock.

#### Stage 1: Accumulation

This stage occurs after prices drop from a much higher level. It its the phase in which the buyers push back against seller to regain control of the stock and prevent it form falling any further.

In the early transition stage from declining to neutral the longer term moving averages are still declining. The stock will cross above and below the averages; once they catch up.

In the middle part of the accumulation stage buyers will hold a floor on the price and accumulate; however, there is no momentum to propel the stock.

The later/last phase of the accumulation stage buyers start buying up the stock making new higher lows on the price but sellers prevent the resistance level from being broken. The moving averages will become flat.

#### Stage 2: Markup

This stage occurs after the resistance from the accumulation stage has been broken and the sellers back off. This is the stage you want to get long on the breakout retest or pullback to a short term moving average. You must want to see higher highs and higher lows. Momentum will kick in and stock will keep advancing higher.

In the first part of stage 2 you should see a sharp upside momentum along with higher highs and higher lows. The short term moving averages should advance sharply.

In the middle part of stage 2 pullbacks will occur often with sharp selloffs where price falls towards a short term moving average. It should find some buying support only to resume the markup shortly after.

The final stage of markup you will see that the momentum is there but fading as it is taking longer to advance higher after pullbacks occur. Gains occur after early short sellers become trapped by shorting too early or via some news catalyst.

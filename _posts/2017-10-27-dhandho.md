Dhandho is a Gujurati word that means business. However, it is a business in which there is very little risk associated with it and has a proven business model. The hotel/motel business is perfect example of this as it has a history of proven solid business model. This principles of Dhandho can also be applied to stocks where you buy undervalued businesses with a high probability upside and low downside.

### Invest in Existing Businesses <a name="existing"></a>
If you were to buy a business right now it would be best to buy a business that is already up and running vs spending capital expenditures to build out one. Its better to do this because operations are already up and running. If you buy into a franchised business then the brand recognition and products are already established. You would just need to run the operations.

The stock market gives a person the ability to buy stock and have ownership in a company and it's underlying business. The best part of owning stock is that the business is already up and running without you having to do any of the work. As an investor into great companies you will get rewarded by asset appreciation, dividends, and ability to liquidate your shares.

Like Patels' buying motels and other businesses during distressed times; there are times where stocks of well run companies become out of favor due to fears of uncertainty/headwinds. This is the time to sort through those businesses and start accumulating shares.

Tips to find cheap businesses:
- Low P/E multiple 10 or less is best
- Look for high dividend yielders (occasionally this works)

- Methods of Share Price Calculation
  - DCF Model
    - discounts all future cash flows for a set time period to the present

<br>

#### IPO Time Table <a name="timetable"></a>

    - 1) company hires advisors to help with analysis, tax, regulation
    - 2) define key issues or problems on compliance
    - 3) valuation of company

  - Execution
    - 5) roadshow to get potential investor and feedback
    - 6) marketing and price range of stock
    - 7) allocate the shares to retail, institutions, hedge funds

- Syndicate Roles
  - Global Coordinator - oversees entire process
  - Bookrunners - market, prepare analyst presentations, and roadshow (1-3 banks)

<br>

#### Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEO) <a name="seoprivate"></a>
- SEO is a seasoned equity offering where a public company already listed raises equity by selling additional shares
- Much easier since company already has regulation needed in place
- Fees are lower since stock is already priced by the market
- Private placement is equity offered to institutional investors only

<br>

### Capital Markets - Debt Capital Markets <a name="capdebt"></a>
#### Bonds <a name="bonds"></a>
- Bonds
  - similar to bank loans
  - investors lend money to business/government and eventually recoupe capital plus interest
  - Four Types
    - Fixed Rate Bonds
      - predetermined rate of return
      - fixed interest rate
      - Maturity of 5, 10, 20 years
    - Floating Rate Bonds
      - linked to a reference rate
      - interest varies as interest rate fluctuates
    - Equity Related Bonds
      - debt securities paying an interest rate
      - can be converted into equity
    - Asset Backed Securities
      - bonds offered by a project vehicle
      - bank loans, credit card debt, mortgage loans and other similar assets

<br>

#### Why Issue Bonds? <a name="issuebonds"></a>
- Bonds are much cheaper than bank loans due to a lower interest rate (as long as company's financials are decent)
- Less covenants or rules/restrictions by the borrower; for example, maintaining key levels of financial ratios
- Benefits larger corporations due to fixed costs associated with bonds; you need scale
- Banks are very risk averse when loaning large amounts of money vs bonds where investors will take risk for higher reward
- Bond holders are in the hundreds and dealing with them is a difficult and complex task

<br>

#### Bond Offerings <a name="bondoffer"></a>
- Similar to equity offering
- Pricing is easier because credit rating agencies rate the company's ability to repay loan
  - Standard and Poor's Rating Services
  - Moody's
  - Fitch Ratings
- Process
  - 25-35 days
  - 1) Hire an advisor
  - 2) Assemble syndicate
  - 3) Hire credit rating agency (2 or more better)
  - 4) IB contact investors and give them provisional conditions such as interest rates and maturity
  - 5) Bookbuilding
  - 6) Underwrite and sell to investors
  - 7) Stabilization service to hold up price of bond

<br>

#### Securitization <a name="securitize"></a>
- Group of loans are collected and group together in a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to be sold to investors
- Reason for this is that banks must maintain a certain capital adequacy ratio (equity/loans > cap adequacy ratio)
- Capital Adequacy Ratio = Bank's Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets
  - to raise ratio you could raise capital (costly) or decrease risk-weighted assets
  - solution was securitization where banks sell the loans and transfer risk to investors
- Banks act as originators where they can lend money to borrowers, package up the loans and sell to investors generating fees
- Securitization allows investors to gain diversification; for example, pension funds can't loan to consumers but can buy securitized loan full of mortgages

<br>

#### Loan Syndication <a name="loansyndicate"></a>
- Large loans pooled from several banks
- Why group loans from multiple banks?
  - reduce loan size
  - access to large corporate clients
  - commission to the lead bank
- Great diversification on a global scale

<br>

### Advisory Services - Mergers & Acquisitions <a name="adma"></a>
#### Why Acquire Another Company? <a name="aquireco"></a>

  - Usually companies are in same industry
  - Some efficient synergies is accounting, sales, IT, finance, basically SGA
  - Extend product/service offering to their customer base
  - Extend product/services by integration
  - Acquiring top talent in management
- Defensive M&A is acquiring a company so that competitor doesn't buy them

<br>

#### Deal Lifecycle <a name="deal"></a>
- Company's Lifecycle
  - Development
    - early days in startup stage
    - rarely acquire company
    - often get acquired if idea is innovative or team is talented
  - Growth
    - ramp up in revenues
    - even more attractive for acquirers
    - defensive M&A of smaller firms
  - Maturity

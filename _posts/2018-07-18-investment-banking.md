#### Importance of History, Name and Tradition <a name="hisnametrad"></a>
- History, Name, and Tradition play an important role for Investment banks because over the years they have built up their
  connections, partnerships and experience allowing them to attract top clients and investors.

#### Early Origins of Investment Banking <a name="earlyorigin"></a>
- IB emerged in the early 19th century when economic expansion was occurring and commercial banks could not serve loan growth for railroads, mining, and heavy industry.
- Security underwriting - when banks buy stocks and bonds from companies and resells them to public.

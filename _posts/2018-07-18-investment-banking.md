- IPO process lasts 4-6 months
- Price is usually given at a discount to keep investors satisfied
- Methods of Share Price Calculation
  - DCF Model
    - discounts all future cash flows for a set time period to the present
  - Multiples
    - finds similar companies that are similar size, industry, geography, and market strategy

  - IB gather what investors are willing to pay during their attempt to sell shares to potential investors
    - Book building is IMPORTANT as it will give you true pricing vs a model

<br>

#### IPO Time Table <a name="timetable"></a>
- Two Phases
  - Pre-launch
    - 1) company hires advisors to help with analysis, tax, regulation
    - 2) define key issues or problems on compliance
    - 3) valuation of company
    - 4) prepare prospectus about 2 months prior to going public
  - Execution
    - 5) roadshow to get potential investor and feedback
    - 6) marketing and price range of stock
    - 7) allocate the shares to retail, institutions, hedge funds

<br>

#### IPO Syndicate <a name="iposyndicate"></a>
- Every IPO involves multiple banks called syndicate banks
- Syndicate banks are each able to allocate shares to their clientele
- Syndicate Roles
  - Global Coordinator - oversees entire process
  - Bookrunners - market, prepare analyst presentations, and roadshow (1-3 banks)
  - Lead Manager - client contacts and selling efforts
- IPO Fees
  - Fees are typically 1.5% - 7% (3% avg) - bigger company lower fees
  - Lead Managers - 60%
  - Bookrunners - 20%
  - Global Coordinator - 20%

<br>

#### Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEO) <a name="seoprivate"></a>
- SEO is a seasoned equity offering where a public company already listed raises equity by selling additional shares
- Much easier since company already has regulation needed in place
- Fees are lower since stock is already priced by the market
- Private placement is equity offered to institutional investors only

<br>

### Capital Markets - Debt Capital Markets <a name="capdebt"></a>
#### Bonds <a name="bonds"></a>
- Bonds
  - similar to bank loans
  - investors lend money to business/government and eventually recoupe capital plus interest
  - Four Types
    - Fixed Rate Bonds
      - predetermined rate of return
      - fixed interest rate
      - Maturity of 5, 10, 20 years
    - Floating Rate Bonds
      - linked to a reference rate
      - interest varies as interest rate fluctuates
    - Equity Related Bonds
      - debt securities paying an interest rate
      - can be converted into equity
    - Asset Backed Securities
      - bonds offered by a project vehicle
      - bank loans, credit card debt, mortgage loans and other similar assets

<br>

#### Why Issue Bonds? <a name="issuebonds"></a>
- Bonds are much cheaper than bank loans due to a lower interest rate (as long as company's financials are decent)
- Less covenants or rules/restrictions by the borrower; for example, maintaining key levels of financial ratios
- Benefits larger corporations due to fixed costs associated with bonds; you need scale
- Banks are very risk averse when loaning large amounts of money vs bonds where investors will take risk for higher reward
- Bond holders are in the hundreds and dealing with them is a difficult and complex task

<br>

#### Bond Offerings <a name="bondoffer"></a>
- Similar to equity offering
- Pricing is easier because credit rating agencies rate the company's ability to repay loan
  - Standard and Poor's Rating Services
  - Moody's
  - Fitch Ratings
- Process
  - 25-35 days
  - 1) Hire an advisor
  - 2) Assemble syndicate
  - 3) Hire credit rating agency (2 or more better)
  - 4) IB contact investors and give them provisional conditions such as interest rates and maturity
  - 5) Bookbuilding
  - 6) Underwrite and sell to investors
  - 7) Stabilization service to hold up price of bond

<br>

#### Securitization <a name="securitize"></a>
- Group of loans are collected and group together in a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to be sold to investors
- Reason for this is that banks must maintain a certain capital adequacy ratio (equity/loans > cap adequacy ratio)
- Capital Adequacy Ratio = Bank's Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets
  - to raise ratio you could raise capital (costly) or decrease risk-weighted assets
  - solution was securitization where banks sell the loans and transfer risk to investors
- Banks act as originators where they can lend money to borrowers, package up the loans and sell to investors generating fees
- Securitization allows investors to gain diversification; for example, pension funds can't loan to consumers but can buy securitized loan full of mortgages

<br>

#### Loan Syndication <a name="loansyndicate"></a>
- Large loans pooled from several banks
- Why group loans from multiple banks?
  - reduce loan size
  - access to large corporate clients
  - commission to the lead bank
- Great diversification on a global scale

<br>

### Advisory Services - Mergers & Acquisitions <a name="adma"></a>
#### Why Acquire Another Company? <a name="aquireco"></a>
- Why Companies Acquire Other Companies?
  - Growth and Synergies
  - Usually companies are in same industry
  - Some efficient synergies is accounting, sales, IT, finance, basically SGA
  - Extend product/service offering to their customer base
  - Extend product/services by integration
  - Acquiring top talent in management
- Defensive M&A is acquiring a company so that competitor doesn't buy them

<br>

#### Deal Lifecycle <a name="deal"></a>

    - ramp up in revenues
    - even more attractive for acquirers
    - defensive M&A of smaller firms
  - Maturity
    - revenue slows down or flattens
    - cash rich company
    - mergers and LBOs instead of getting acquired
  - Decline
    - revenue starts to decline
    - takeovers or restructuring

<br>

#### M&A Types <a name="matype"></a>
- Private Transaction (1-2 bidders)
  - easy to organize
  - no sense of urgency for the buyer since they don't feel threatened by company
  - often avoided by sell-side
- Auction (many bidders)
  - many interested bidders with goal of 3-5 offers
  - competition causes increase in price
- Listed Firm (public company)
  - complicated due to regulatory requirements
  - friendly or hostile takeover (tender offer)
  - easier valuation since public  (usually offers premium to shares)

<br>

#### Valuation of Targets <a name="targetvalue"></a>
- Buyer
  - find fair value for target
- Seller
 - decide if it is right price to sell
- Both need to understand and idea about the value of underlying business
  - acquiring company will end up taking on liabilities
  - Enterprise Value = Equity + Net Debt
    - influenced by capital structure
  - Equity = Total value of a firm's shares
    - not influenced by capital structure
- Use DCF, Multiples, LBO Analysis, Market Price (if public)
  - bankers use couple methods
  - DCF is most popular method and use discount future cash flows to present
  - Multiples compare similar company in same/similar industry, size, market positioning, number of employees, geography, growth perspectives
  - LBO is based on how much leverage is sustainable by the target
  - Market Price is just share price times number of outstanding shares = equity

<br>

#### Payment <a name="payment"></a>
- Cash
  - preferred by targets so they can monetize immediately
  - buyers must be prepared (Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Google)
  - must consider cost of issuing new debt
- Stock
  - buyers interested in stock to avoid borrowing
  - must consider cost of issuing new stock
  - allows targets to retain possible future upside
- Combination
  - usually both happens or a choice is given
- Deal breakers usually when buyer/seller have a difference of >5% for the price
- Earn-out mechanism could be applied for differences <5%
  - goals are set that if met additional payouts will be made
  - ex: if margin of 20% is met in 2 years after closing then $50M will be awarded
  - seller keeps upside but it can also be difficult to measure

<br>

#### Corporate Vs Financial Buyers <a name="corpvsfin"></a>
- Corporate Buyers

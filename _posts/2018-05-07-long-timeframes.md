I was reading one of the AMA threads on StockTwits a few months ago when I stumbled on an AMA from Zen Trends founder Cody Freedman; [read here](https://blog.stocktwits.com/how-to-become-a-trend-trader-and-why-you-should-use-more-monthly-charts-6eb169654ade). His strategy was a simple trend trading strategy such that you follow the trend until it changes and you look at higher timeframes instead of daily. This helps reduce the day to day noise of the stock's volatility and helps a trader look at the big picture of where the stock is head.

Over the past month I have studied and incorporated his strategy and even copied his chart layout to mimic his strategy. When I looked at past performance on growth stocks, in an uptrend, I was surprised at how well the 20 day moving average played as a pivotal turning point. Below are Cody's rules and his timeframe for the swing trade is between 1-12 months.

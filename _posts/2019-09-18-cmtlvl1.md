The CMT certification stands for Chartered Market Technician. It is like what a CFA is to financial analysis but the CMT is equivalent to technical analysis. As I am studying for the level 1 exam below are my notes for quick reference for the CMT Level 1 Curriculum 2019 by Wiley.

### Theory & History of Technical Analysis <a name="theoryta"></a>
#### The Basic Principle of Technical Analysis - The Trend <a name="thetrend"></a>
Technical Analysis (TA) is based on one key assumption: Freely traded market prices travel in trends. It is what makes buyers buy a security as well as sell it because of the trend. TAs use charts, moving averages, oscillators, support and resistance etc... to predict movement of price and overall trend.

<br>

<b>How Does The Technical Analyst Make Money</b>
- Identify the beginning/end of a trend and jump on it as early as possible to ride the trend.
- Investors must determine 2 key points before a position
  - When to take profit (price target)
  - When to cut losses if price moves against you (stop loss)
- TAs must calculate their stop loss price to avoid being <b>ruin</b> (heavy losses)
- Three important phrases
  - "The trend is your friend" - follow the trend
  - Don't Lose - minimize losses
  - Manage Your Money - avoid ruin

<br>

<b>What is a Trend</b>
- There are three trends uptrend, down-trend, sideways
  - uptrend is when price has higher peaks and troughs
  - down-trend is when price has lower peaks and lower troughs
  - sideways is when prices fluctuates between a range without any significant upward/downward movement
- TAs definition of a trend is a directional movement of prices that remain in effect long enough to be identified and still profitable

<br>

<b>How are Trend Lines Identified</b>
- Linear Least-Squares Regression
  - plotting out all the prices and using a best fit line to determine trend
- Trend Lines (preferred)
  - plot a point connecting the highest price points and another line connecting the lowest price points in a reasonable time frame.
  - these lines are called trend lines and in addition to the trend they can also give us the limits of price points

<br>

<b>Trends Develop From Supply and Demand</b>
- When a price moves in a specific direction it is because there are either more sellers or buyers
  - Buyer is <b>demand</b> and puts out a <b>bid</b> price
  - Seller is <b>supply</b> and puts out an <b>ask</b> price
- TAs believe that using price is the way to determine supply and demand

<br>

<b>What Trends Are There</b>
- There are infinite amount of trend lines and can be created at any point in time depending on the investor but they all act similarly over time which is why they are <b>fractal</b> nature
- Period of interest is up to the investor (long, medium, short) but they should always go further out on the time frame to view the overall trend; smaller trends make up larger ones
- Trend Periods
  - Primary (months or years)
  - Intermediate (weeks or months)
  - Short-term (days)
  - Intraday (minutes or hours)

<br>

<b>What Other Assumptions Do Technical Analysts Make</b>
- Price is determined by interaction of supply and demand
- Price discounts everything so all information known is taken into account at the price
- Markets trend therefore prices are nonrandom
- History repeats itself such that humans will behave similarly to how they have in the past
- Price patterns are fractal just like trend lines
- Emotions are affected by earlier emotions through emotional feedback

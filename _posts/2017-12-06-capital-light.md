I was listening to the "Invest Like the Best" (listen below) podcast the other day and was intrigued by the guest Connor Leonard investment strategy because it was similar to Buffet's model. Connor runs IMC's public markets portfolio where he utilizes a value based strategy to small cap stocks for the long term. His strategy is to look for companies that can use their "moat" to grow the earnings and cash flow; time horizon is 5+ years. He classifies companies into four categories: no moats or advantages, legacy, reinvestment, and capital light compounders.

Before I explain the moats lets dig down into why Connor implements his strategy. He stated that the old school of value investing has shifted from qualitative to quantitative. The days where you could pick up cheap no brainer opportunities have been taken away by machines implementing algos faster than one can find a stock and hit buy themselves.

Java is a high-level programming language that can run java applications on any operating system via the java virtual machine (JVM). Its signature phrase "Write Once, Run Anywhere". Java is also the underlying language for the Android OS. The Java syntax is similar to C-style languages such as: C, C++, JavaScript. Although Java is slower in speed than the other languages the best feature of Java is that is dynamically manages memory for you. If you can learn and understand the Java language then learning other languages will be a walk in the park.

#### CLI Compile & Run <a name="cli-compile-run"></a>
To compile your java class you need to navigate using your console to the `src` directory. You then need to compile your java class using `javac Name.java` and Java is case sensitive. Then to run the compiled app you use `java Name` without the .class.

To view a list of all the `javac` commands type `javac` to view the entire list. If you want to see what java compiler is doing in the background use the `-verbose` command and it will list every action being done while compiling.

#### Memory Management <a name="memory"></a>
Java manages memory usage automatically using the garbage collector. When you create an object they are stored in heap memory and as long as the variable references an object it is retained.

Variables expire in 2 ways. The first is if you are running a code block in which a variable is created then after the block has been executed then the variable that was created can be destroyed. The second way is for you to assign the variable to `null`.

The garbage collector has its own set of algorithm to identify when to destroy and reclaim memory. You as the developer can design your program to use the least amount of memory as possible. If you need to know the amount of memory available use the below methods to assist.

  - Runtime.maxMemory()
  - Runtime.totalMemory()
  - Runtime.freeMemory()

### Data Types <a name="data-types"></a>
Everything in Java is an object. Each data type has their own class for example: strings have their own class called String with several useful methods that can be used. Each time you create a data type you are creating an instance of a class.

<br>

#### Declare and Initialize Variables <a name="variables"></a>
There are two types of variables that Java has. Primitives are stored in fast memory and are Integers, Floats, Chars, or Booleans. The other data type is complex objects which can be Strings, Dates and everything else.

To declare a primitive data type in Java you need to 3 things.
  - Data Type
  - Variable Name
  - Value (optional)

``` java
// data type - variable name = value
int myVar = 15;
```
To declare objects you also need to 3 things and the `new` keyword.

``` java
// data type class - variable name = initial value from constructor
Dog fido = new Dog();
```

You can declare variables inside a function or outside which will change the variable's scope visibility. If you declare it inside the function the variable can only be used inside the function. If it is declared outside then it is a class/field variable and can be used everywhere.

#### Numbers <a name="numbers"></a>

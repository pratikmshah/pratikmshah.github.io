Java is a high-level programming language that can run java applications on any operating system via the java virtual machine (JVM). Its signature phrase "Write Once, Run Anywhere". Java is also the underlying language for the Android OS. The Java syntax is similar to C-style languages such as: C, C++, JavaScript. Although Java is slower in speed than the other languages the best feature of Java is that is dynamically manages memory for you. If you can learn and understand the Java language then learning other languages will be a walk in the park.

### CLI Compile & Run <a name="cli-compile-run"></a>
To compile your java class you need to navigate using your console to the `src` directory. You then need to compile your java class using `javac Name.java` and Java is case sensitive. Then to run the compiled app you use `java Name` without the .class.

To view a list of all the `javac` commands type `javac` to view the entire list. If you want to see what java compiler is doing in the background use the `-verbose` command and it will list every action being done while compiling.

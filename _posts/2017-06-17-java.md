Java is a high-level programming language that can run java applications on any operating system via the java virtual machine (JVM). Its signature phrase "Write Once, Run Anywhere". Java is also the underlying language for the Android OS. The Java syntax is similar to C-style languages such as: C, C++, JavaScript. Although Java is slower in speed than the other languages the best feature of Java is that is dynamically manages memory for you. If you can learn and understand the Java language then learning other languages will be a walk in the park.

#### CLI Compile & Run <a name="cli-compile-run"></a>
To compile your java class you need to navigate using your console to the `src` directory. You then need to compile your java class using `javac Name.java` and Java is case sensitive. Then to run the compiled app you use `java Name` without the .class.

To view a list of all the `javac` commands type `javac` to view the entire list. If you want to see what java compiler is doing in the background use the `-verbose` command and it will list every action being done while compiling.

#### Memory Management <a name="memory"></a>
Java manages memory usage automatically using the garbage collector. When you create an object they are stored in heap memory and as long as the variable references an object it is retained.

Variables expire in 2 ways. The first is if you are running a code block in which a variable is created then after the block has been executed then the variable that was created can be destroyed. The second way is for you to assign the variable to `null`.

The garbage collector has its own set of algorithm to identify when to destroy and reclaim memory. You as the developer can design your program to use the least amount of memory as possible. If you need to know the amount of memory available use the below methods to assist.

  - Runtime.maxMemory()
  - Runtime.totalMemory()
  - Runtime.freeMemory()

<br>

### Data Types <a name="data-types"></a>
Everything in Java is an object. Each data type has their own class for example: strings have their own class called String with several useful methods that can be used. Each time you create a data type you are creating an instance of a class.

<br>

#### Declare and Initialize Variables <a name="variables"></a>
There are two types of variables that Java has. Primitives are stored in fast memory and are Integers, Floats, Chars, or Booleans. The other data type is complex objects which can be Strings, Dates and everything else.

To declare a primitive data type in Java you need to 3 things.
  - Data Type
  - Variable Name
  - Value (optional)

``` java
// data type - variable name = value
int myVar = 15;
```
To declare objects you also need to 3 things and the `new` keyword.

``` java
// data type class - variable name = initial value from constructor
Dog fido = new Dog();
```

You can declare variables inside a function or outside which will change the variable's scope visibility. If you declare it inside the function the variable can only be used inside the function. If it is declared outside then it is a class/field variable and can be used everywhere.

<br>

#### Numbers <a name="numbers"></a>
A primitive data type has only one value and cannot hold complex objects such as strings.

<table class="table">

``` java
/* PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES */

byte b = 2;

short s = 15;

int i = 100;

/*
 L, f and d should be included else the value will be cast from byte short int to long, float or double causing more memory to be used.
*/

long l = 1000L;

float f = 125.75f;

double d = 125.5d;
```

You can access each primitive value's helper class which is typically the data type with the first letter being capitalized ex: `byte -> Byte`. Only exception is `int -> Integer`.

If you are doing big computational or currency and need precision then you need to use the `BigDecimal` class. Create the `BigDecimal` object from a string or else you will have floater values and will lose precision.

``` java
// create BigDecimal object
double d = 123.45;
String dStr = Double.toString(d);
BigDecimal bigDec = new BigDecimal(dStr);
System.out.println(bigDec.toString());
```
<br>

#### Convert Numbers <a name="cnumbers"></a>
The primitive data types from the smallest to the largest memory usage and value storage are:
 - byte
 - short
 - int
 - long
 - float
 - double
You can implicitly convert a number upwards from short to int to long by assigning the value of the smaller type to the bigger one.

``` java
int i = 15;           // 15
long longUpcast = i;  // 15.0
```

If you want to convert downwards then you need to explicitly tell the compiler via typecast. An alternative is to use a helper class method from the class of the type.

``` java
// typecasting
double dubVal = 15.74;      
int intDowncast = (int)dubVal;

// helper class
double dValue = 5.55;
double doubleObject = new Double(dValue);
int i = doubleObject.intValue();
```
<br>

#### Operators <a name="operator"></a>
There are several types of operators that allow you to manipulate and evaluate expressions.
 - assignment
 - equality/relational
 - mathematical
 - conditional
 - ternary

 The assignment operator `=` is used to assign a value from the right to the data type on the left ex: `int i = 5;`

 Math operators are similar to how they are in other languages.
  - addition `+` ex: `int x = 15 + 5;`
  - subtraction `-` ex: `int x = 15 - 5;`
  - multiplication `*` ex: `int x = 15 * 5;`
  - division `/` ex: `int x = 15 / 5;`
  - modulus `%` ex: `int x = 11 % 5;` will give remainder
  - increment `++` ex: `x++;` will increment by 1
  - decrement `--` ex: `x--;` will decrement by 1
  - postfix `x++` will evaluate x then increment by one
  - prefix `++x` will increment x by one and then evaluate x
  - short addition `+=` ex: `i += 5` will take value of i and add 5
  - short subtraction `-=` ex: `i -= 5` will take value of i and subtract 5
  - short multiplication `*=` ex: `i += 5` will take value of i and multiply 5
  - short division `/=` ex: `i /= 5` will take value of i and divide 5

  Equality or Relational Operators
  - `>` greater than
  - `<` less than
  - `>=` greater than or equal to
  - `<=` less than or equal to
  - `==` equal to (not strick)
  - `===` equal to and same class type
  - `!=` not equal to
  - `!false` changes false to true
  - `&&` both sides must evaluate to true
  - `||` at least one side must evaluate to true
  - `instanceof` Class membership ex: `str instanceof java.lang.String`

<br>

#### Characters <a name="char"></a>
You can work with single characters by using the primitive data type of `char`. To assign variable to a single character you must use single quotes. You can also assign [unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) to characters. You can use the `Character` class to find helper methods.

``` java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    char chr1 = 'a';
    char chr2 = 'A';
    char chr3 = '3';
    char pound = '\u00A3';

    System.out.println(chr1);
    System.out.println(chr2);
    System.out.println(chr3);
    System.out.println(pound);

    char chr4 = 'y';

    System.out.println(Character.toUpperCase(chr4));    

  }
}
```
<br>

#### Booleans <a name="bool"></a>
Booleans are `true` or `false` values thats it. Use the `Boolean` class in order to use helper methods.

``` java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean x = true;
    boolean y = false;
    System.out.println(x);  // prints true    
    System.out.println(y);  // prints false

    boolean b = !x;
    System.out.println(b);  // prints false

    int i = 5;
    boolean num = (i != 3);
    System.out.println(num); // prints true   

  }
}
```
<br>

#### Strings <a name="str"></a>
Java can print any number type as a string which it automatically does when using the print or println. In Java it doesn't matter if you concatenate and begin the expression with a number because if there is one string involved the entire expression becomes a string. Every object in Java has a `toString()` method. So if you were concatenating an object to a string it would call its `toString()` method.


``` java
import java.util.Date;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 1421313;
    double d = 3.14;

    System.out.println(i);   
    System.out.println(d);

    System.out.println(1 + " string " + 5);  

    Date today = new Date();
    System.out.println("The date is " + today);

  }
}
```
<br>

### Control Flow <a name="ctrl"></a>

#### Conditionals <a name="condition"></a>
Use the keyword `if` to control the flow of the program. The syntax is `if (condition)` followed by a code block. You can also add in the additional keywords `else if` and `else` for multiple condition checks. If you are comparing strings you will need to use methods from the string class to compare ex: `equals(str)` `str.equals(str2)`.

``` java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 5;

    if (i == 5) {
      System.out.println("Excellent Rating!");
    }
    else if (i < 5 && i > 2) {
      System.out.println("Good but not great.");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("Junk Rating");
    }
  }
}
```
<br>

#### Switch Statement <a name="switch"></a>
Use switch statements to evaluate a single int, byte, short, enum and string (Java 7 only). Use the `switch`, `case`, `break`, and `default` keywords. The `break` keyword is used to exit a code block. You can also use `enum` which are a list of constants and good to pair with switch statements.

``` java
// switch structure
switch (key) {
  case value:

    break;

  default;
    break;
}
```

``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Rate this ad with a # between 1 - 5: ");
    int rate = input.nextInt();

    switch (rate) {
      case 5:
        System.out.println("Excellent");
        break;
      case 4:
        System.out.println("Great");
        break;
      case 3:
        System.out.println("Average");
        break;
      case 2:
        System.out.println("Poor");
        break;
      case 1:
        System.out.println("Bad");
        break;
      default:
        System.out.println("Out of range select between 1 - 5");
        break;
    }
  }
}
```
``` java
// enum example
public class Main {

  public enum Days {
    Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Days day = Days.Tuesday;

    System.out.println(day.Thursday);
  }

}
```

<br>

#### Loops <a name="loop"></a>
There are several types of loops that can be helpful repeating the same code over and over or loop through and array. When creating loops you need to make sure that there will be a point in time when the condition returns false or else you will have an infinite loop.

The `for` loop consists of three parts: `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)`. The first is a counter variable. The second is the comparison that when return false will exit the loop. The last is an increment to the counter variable.

The `for each` loop is used to loop through an entire array or hash once ex: `for (Integer day : days)`.

The `while` loop checks the condition first then runs the code ex: `while (x != 0)`.

The `do while` loop runs the code at least once and then checks the condition ex: `do { code } while (x != 0);`.

``` java
public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] data = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 };

    // For Loop
    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
      System.out.println(data[i]);
    }

    // For Each
    for (Integer num : data) {
      System.out.println(num);
    }

    // While Loop
    int  i = 0;
    while (i < data.length) {
      System.out.println(data[i]);
      i++;
    }

    // Do While Loop
    int j = 0;
    do {
      System.out.println(data[j]);
      j++;
    } while (j < data.length);

  }
}
```
<br>

I remember when I first started investing and trading. I had no clue what I was doing. I would hear about a merger and rush into the stock only to watch it fall in coming months. Or I'd find a stock with a high dividend yield only to to see the stock price fall and collapse. I was buying whenever I thought the price was right and not thinking about what was the perceived sentiment of the company or what price would buyers step in to stop the falling knife, as they call it. Technical analysis changed all this as this study of charting price action is used by millions of investors/traders to evaluate when it is time to buy, sell, or hold a stock. I plan on making this post a primer to technical analysis; you may want to bookmark this post as it will be updated over time.

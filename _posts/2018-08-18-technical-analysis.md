I remember when I first started investing and trading. I had no clue what I was doing. I would hear about a merger and rush into the stock only to watch it fall in coming months. Or I'd find a stock with a high dividend yield only to to see the stock price fall and collapse. I was buying whenever I thought the price was right and not thinking about what was the perceived sentiment of the company or what price would buyers step in to stop the falling knife, as they call it. Technical analysis changed all this as this study of charting price action is used by millions of investors/traders to evaluate when it is time to buy, sell, or hold a stock. I plan on making this post a primer to technical analysis; you may want to bookmark this post as it will be updated over time. My notes here are from a great course on Technical Analysis from Investopedia Academy.

### Technical Analysis <a name="techanalysis"></a>
#### History of Technical Analysis <a name="techhistory"></a>
Technical analysis is the study of the market and its buyers/sellers. Markets can be related to any transaction such as stocks, futures, currencies, commodities etc...

Robert D. Edwards and John Magee wrote the bible of technical analysis like how Benjamin Graham and David Dodd wrote the book on value investing and securities analysis. However, we can go back further in time and see that Charles Dow, creator of Dow Jones Industrial Average, studied price action of a stock and noticed that stocks generally rise together and likewise fall together.

He created the first "ETF" and grouped companies that make the goods and companies that move/ship the goods.

#### Technical Analysis Vs Fundamental Analysis <a name="techvsfund"></a>
- Fundamental
  - earnings of companies
  - direction of interest rates
  - micro and macro economic developments
  - competitors of companies
  - and a lot more variables that effect underlying company
  - looking for valuation of the company
- Technical
  - assume all information and fundamentals have been priced into a stock
  - analysis can be applied across all trading vehicles
  - works on supply and demand principle

<br>

### Charts <a name="charts"></a>
#### Arithmetic vs Logarithmic <a name="arilog"></a>
You will immediately see that logarithmic charts are not evenly spaced on the Y axis. The larger the space means the larger the percentage change in price. Arithmetic chart on the other hand has an evenly spaced out Y axis. Logarithmic charts show price volatility a lot more clearly vs an arithmetic chart.

#### Timeframes <a name="timeframe"></a>
You can view price changes over different timeframes seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. Specific timeframes are well suited for different types of participants. It is best to go one timeframe higher to check for confirmation.

- Chart Timeframes
  - Day Traders
    - minutes plus daily
  - Swing Traders
    - daily plus weekly
  - Investors
    - monthly and yearly

#### Clean Charts <a name="cleanchart"></a>
Keep charts clean and with minimal indicators. Over doing indicators and lines makes things difficult to read and evaluate price.

### Chart Analysis <a name="chartanal"></a>
#### Bar Chart <a name="barchart"></a>
A bar chart is a composed of simple vertical line with a small horizontal line on the left and right of the bar. The bottom of the line shows the lowest price of that period and top shows the highest price of that period. The length of the bar is the difference between the highest and lowest price for that period. The left line shows the opening price for that period and the right line shows the closing price for that period.

#### Candlestick <a name="candle"></a>
The most widely used chart is the Japanese candlestick chart. The concept was created by Munehisa Homma who was a rice trader in the 1700s. Its similar to the bar chart but tells a bigger story of how the period went. The candles can be filled(red/bearish) and hollow(green/bullish). The wicks tell us more about the price action for the period such that if the top wick is long it shows that there were more sellers. Likewise, if the shadow was long on the bottom and short on top it means there were more buyers.

This chart type is very important for short term traders, in my opinion, as when you start putting together many candlesticks together you can gain some insight as to what pattern(s) are forming.

#### Candlesticks Doji <a name="candledoji"></a>
Sometimes you will see candlestick with no real body and those are called dojis. Dojis mean that the market was indecisive that day and the opening and close are virtually identical.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Types of Dojis</figcaption>
</figure>

The two types of important dojis are the dragonfly and gravestone doji. The dragonfly doji has long bottom wick and closes at the top. When you see this in a downtrend it most likely means trend is starting to shift to bullish. Likewise the gravestone doji shows that buyers were getting exhausted during the period. If you see this in an uptrend it could most likely be trend is shifting to bearish.

<br>

#### Line Chart <a name="linechart"></a>
The line chart plots the closing price point of each period. When you plot several of these points together and connect the dots a directional pattern will emerge in which you can visually see the trend. The closing price is most important point on any chart as it is the agreed upon price by market participants for that period.

The best use case for line charts is when you compare two assets classes to see the performance between the two.

#### Moving Averages <a name="average"></a>
Next to candlestick charts I believe that the moving average is the second most important tool for any technical analyst and trader. It is a smoothing mechanism for price changes. The three types of moving averages are simple, exponential, and geometric.

- Simple
  - arithmetic moving avearge calculated by adding recent closing prices and then dividing that by X number of periods (ex: 20, 50, 200 days).
- Exponential
  - same as simple moving average but it is a weighted moving average that gives more importance to recent price data.
- Geometric
  - takes into account the compounding that occurs from period to period.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/tech-analysis/movingaverage.png" class="blg-img" alt="Moving avearages">
  <figcaption>Moving Averages: Exponential(purple) & Simple(blue)</figcaption>
</figure>

Moving average IS NOT a support or resistance area but its a supplement to help view the direction of the trend. If the moving average is flat it means that the stock is moving sideways and will be choppy; STAY AWAY. When a stock falls near or under a moving average but the direction of the long term trend is still up those would be perfect time to buy.

<br>

#### Trend Lines <a name="trendlines"></a>
Our entire goal as technicians is to identify trends in stocks. We want to be buying stocks in uptrends and sell stocks in downtrends. Minimum points of contact needed to draw a trend line is 2. When market returns to that contact point it should signal buyer/sellers to come in.

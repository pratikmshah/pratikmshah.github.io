I remember when I first started investing and trading. I had no clue what I was doing. I would hear about a merger and rush into the stock only to watch it fall in coming months. Or I'd find a stock with a high dividend yield only to to see the stock price fall and collapse. I was buying whenever I thought the price was right and not thinking about what was the perceived sentiment of the company or what price would buyers step in to stop the falling knife, as they call it. Technical analysis changed all this as this study of charting price action is used by millions of investors/traders to evaluate when it is time to buy, sell, or hold a stock. I plan on making this post a primer to technical analysis; you may want to bookmark this post as it will be updated over time. My notes here are from a great course on Technical Analysis from Investopedia Academy.

### Technical Analysis <a name="techanalysis"></a>
#### History of Technical Analysis <a name="techhistory"></a>
Technical analysis is the study of the market and its buyers/sellers. Markets can be related to any transaction such as stocks, futures, currencies, commodities etc...

Robert D. Edwards and John Magee wrote the bible of technical analysis like how Benjamin Graham and David Dodd wrote the book on value investing and securities analysis. However, we can go back further in time and see that Charles Dow, creator of Dow Jones Industrial Average, studied price action of a stock and noticed that stocks generally rise together and likewise fall together.

He created the first "ETF" and grouped companies that make the goods and companies that move/ship the goods.

<br>

#### Technical Analysis Vs Fundamental Analysis <a name="techvsfund"></a>
- Fundamental
  - earnings of companies
  - direction of interest rates
  - micro and macro economic developments
  - competitors of companies
  - and a lot more variables that effect underlying company
  - looking for valuation of the company
- Technical
  - assume all information and fundamentals have been priced into a stock
  - analysis can be applied across all trading vehicles
  - works on supply and demand principle

<br>

### Charts <a name="charts"></a>
#### Arithmetic vs Logarithmic <a name="arilog"></a>
You will immediately see that logarithmic charts are not evenly spaced on the Y axis. The larger the space means the larger the percentage change in price. Arithmetic chart on the other hand has an evenly spaced out Y axis. Logarithmic charts show price volatility a lot more clearly vs an arithmetic chart.

#### Timeframes <a name="timeframe"></a>
You can view price changes over different timeframes seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. Specific timeframes are well suited for different types of participants. It is best to go one timeframe higher to check for confirmation.

- Chart Timeframes
  - Day Traders
    - minutes plus daily
  - Swing Traders
    - daily plus weekly
  - Investors
    - monthly and yearly

#### Clean Charts <a name="cleanchart"></a>
Keep charts clean and with minimal indicators. Over doing indicators and lines makes things difficult to read and evaluate price.

### Chart Analysis <a name="chartanal"></a>
#### Bar Chart <a name="barchart"></a>
A bar chart is a composed of simple vertical line with a small horizontal line on the left and right of the bar. The bottom of the line shows the lowest price of that period and top shows the highest price of that period. The length of the bar is the difference between the highest and lowest price for that period. The left line shows the opening price for that period and the right line shows the closing price for that period.

#### Candlestick <a name="candle"></a>
The most widely used chart is the Japanese candlestick chart. The concept was created by Munehisa Homma who was a rice trader in the 1700s. Its similar to the bar chart but tells a bigger story of how the period went. The candles can be filled(red/bearish) and hollow(green/bullish). The wicks tell us more about the price action for the period such that if the top wick is long it shows that there were more sellers. Likewise, if the shadow was long on the bottom and short on top it means there were more buyers.

<figure>

</figure>

This chart type is very important for short term traders, in my opinion, as when you start putting together many candlesticks together you can gain some insight as to what pattern(s) are forming.

<figure>

#### Candlesticks Doji <a name="candledoji"></a>
Sometimes you will see candlestick with no real body and those are called dojis. Dojis mean that the market was indecisive that day and the opening and close are virtually identical.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/tech-analysis/dojis.png" class="blg-img" alt="types of dojis">
  <figcaption>Types of Dojis</figcaption>
</figure>

The two types of important dojis are the dragonfly and gravestone doji. The dragonfly doji has long bottom wick and closes at the top. When you see this in a downtrend it most likely means trend is starting to shift to bullish. Likewise the gravestone doji shows that buyers were getting exhausted during the period. If you see this in an uptrend it could most likely be trend is shifting to bearish.

<br>

#### Line Chart <a name="linechart"></a>
The line chart plots the closing price point of each period. When you plot several of these points together and connect the dots a directional pattern will emerge in which you can visually see the trend. The closing price is most important point on any chart as it is the agreed upon price by market participants for that period.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/tech-analysis/line.JPG" class="blg-img" alt="line chart">

The best use case for line charts is when you compare two assets classes to see the performance between the two.

<br>

#### Moving Averages <a name="average"></a>
Next to candlestick charts I believe that the moving average is the second most important tool for any technical analyst and trader. It is a smoothing mechanism for price changes. The three types of moving averages are simple, exponential, and geometric.

- Simple
  - arithmetic moving avearge calculated by adding recent closing prices and then dividing that by X number of periods (ex: 20, 50, 200 days).
- Exponential
  - same as simple moving average but it is a weighted moving average that gives more importance to recent price data.
- Geometric
  - takes into account the compounding that occurs from period to period.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/tech-analysis/movingaverage.png" class="blg-img" alt="Moving avearages">
  <figcaption>Moving Averages: Exponential(purple) & Simple(blue)</figcaption>
</figure>

Moving average IS NOT a support or resistance area but its a supplement to help view the direction of the trend. If the moving average is flat it means that the stock is moving sideways and will be choppy; STAY AWAY. When a stock falls near or under a moving average but the direction of the long term trend is still up those would be perfect time to buy.

<br>

#### Trend Lines <a name="trendlines"></a>
Our entire goal as technicians is to identify trends in stocks. We want to be buying stocks in uptrends and sell stocks in downtrends. Minimum points of contact needed to draw a trend line is 2. When market returns to that contact point it should signal buyer/sellers to come in.

<br>

#### Trend Lines Horizons <a name="trendlineshorizon"></a>
You can connect many new trend lines depending on the time horizon. You start creating fan lines as they are called to spot the short term trends within the longer term trends. See previous section image to see Amazon's trendlines.

<br>

#### Trend Lines Kickback <a name="trendlineskickback"></a>
The kickback is when price breaks through the trendline and then comes back up to try and retest the line but usually gets rejected and fails. That is basically last opportunity to sell before it falls and a new trend forms.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Kickback: price rejected after trendline breaks</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

#### Trend Identification <a name="trendidentification"></a>
Three main questions to ask when identifying a trend:

1. In which direction is the trend of the other stocks in this sector? (Sector ETFS)
2. In which direction is the trend for other stocks in this country? (US, China, Emerging Markets)
3. In which direction are the major stock indexes heading? (S&P500 & DOW)

### Understanding Technical Analysis <a name="undertech"></a>
#### Support And Resistance <a name="supres"></a>
Support is just another name for buying at a certain price area. If price should happen to fall there once again buyers should come in and prevent the price from falling. The more a price area is tested and holds the stronger that level should be in the future should price fall.

Resistance is just another name for selling at a certain price area. If price rises to that area once again sellers will come in and prevent stock from rising. The more an area is tested the more significance it becomes.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Support (green line) and Resistance (red line)</figcaption>
</figure>


<br>

#### Polarity 101 <a name="polarity"></a>
The main key point here is that <strong>support & resistance is where price gets rejected quickly</strong>. If price is constantly hugging against support or resistance its most likely going to break so watch out. The more times a level is tested the more likely it is to break. The reason is simply that the buyers and sellers at that level are gone.

Once price breaks resistance that level becomes support and if price breaks support that area now becomes resistance. Very similar to kickbacks in trendlines. The buyers move up in willingness to pay for asset and sellers move to a higher level. Reverse is same for when support is broken.

<br>

#### Polarity Psychology <a name="polarpsych"></a>
They reasoning behind support and resistance polarity is that buyers and sellers have shifted their price at which they are willing to buy or sell.

Resistance becomes support theory - Lets say a stock keeps getting sold off at $20. Once the stock breaks and there are no sellers left buyers drive up the price up to $30 and then stock sells off once high enough. The people who missed their opportunity the first time now buy at the previous resistance level creating support. Also people who shorted at resistance level cover their short.

Support becomes resistance - Lets say a stock keeps getting bought at $20 but one day people buy and the sellers drive price down to $10. On the next leg up the people who bought at support will sell to break even and shorts will start shorting in anticipation of this.

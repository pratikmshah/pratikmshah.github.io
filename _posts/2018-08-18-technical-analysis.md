I remember when I first started investing and trading. I had no clue what I was doing. I would hear about a merger and rush into the stock only to watch it fall in coming months. Or I'd find a stock with a high dividend yield only to to see the stock price fall and collapse. I was buying whenever I thought the price was right and not thinking about what was the perceived sentiment of the company or what price would buyers step in to stop the falling knife, as they call it. Technical analysis changed all this as this study of charting price action is used by millions of investors/traders to evaluate when it is time to buy, sell, or hold a stock. I plan on making this post a primer to technical analysis; you may want to bookmark this post as it will be updated over time. My notes here are from a great course on Technical Analysis from Investopedia Academy.

### Technical Analysis <a name="techanalysis"></a>
#### History of Technical Analysis <a name="techhistory"></a>
Technical analysis is the study of the market and its buyers/sellers. Markets can be related to any transaction such as stocks, futures, currencies, commodities etc...

Robert D. Edwards and John Magee wrote the bible of technical analysis like how Benjamin Graham and David Dodd wrote the book on value investing and securities analysis. However, we can go back further in time and see that Charles Dow, creator of Dow Jones Industrial Average, studied price action of a stock and noticed that stocks generally rise together and likewise fall together.

He created the first "ETF" and grouped companies that make the goods and companies that move/ship the goods.

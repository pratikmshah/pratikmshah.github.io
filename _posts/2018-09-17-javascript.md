Javascript is one of the core programming language for the web. Its purpose was to make web pages more interactive to the user. Over time the language has grown from only being used on the client side to being embedded into other server-side technologies. Also there have been extensive frameworks built on top of JavaScript such as React and Angular. Lately the trend has been to move away from other languages, such as Ruby, and to just use native JavaScript.

Python is a programming language which has gained quite attraction for people working with data; especially in the finance industry.  One reason why is its vast amounts of open source libraries for data manipulation and analysis such as Pandas, NumPy and TensorFlow. Python is also very strict in syntax so you are almost guaranteed to have neat code because if you are missing even one space your editor will complain.

### Requirements? <a name="requirements"></a>

You will need to install a version of Python 3 from the installer found [here](https://www.python.org/). You will also need to a text editor and two popular ones as of this time are [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/). and [atom](http://atom.io/). Once those are installed you are ready to begin.

<br>

### Syntax <a name="syntax"></a>

#### Main

The main function is used so that functions can be invoked no matter where the function is defined. We need an if statement to insure that the main function gets called if one exists in the script.

``` python
#!/usr/bin/python3
# auto exec main function if exists

def main():
  print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__": main()

```
<br>

#### Whitespace
The whitespace tell the compiler that the statements are associated with the preceding function or conditional. Traditionally there are 4 spaces for indentation. There are no character braces ({}) like there are in other languages to specify a block.

``` python
# this is correct
def main():
  print("Hello World!")
  print("Line 2")

# if you have one line to exec you can put all on one line
# you can put spaces after :
def main():print("This will work")

#....
if __name__ == "__main__": main()

```
<br>

#### Comments
To comment use the `#` symbol for one line comments. Other languages have multi line comments; however, in python they should be avoided.

``` python
# this is a comment
```
<br>

#### Assignment
Assigning values is just like other languages by using the `=` operator. You also don't need to specify the type of variable being created; like in ruby.

You can see the class of the variable by using the `type(x)` function. Also you can mass assign variable in a single line.

#### Conditionals Structure
The conditionals are similarly structured to how they are in other languages. Use `if`, `elif`, `else` to evaluate statements

``` python
a, b = 1, 2

if a < b:
  print("first statement")
elif a > b:
  print("second statement")
else:
  print("third statement")
```
<br>

You can use ternary operation but instead of `?` and `:` you use `if` and `else`.

``` python
a, b = 1, 2
x = "is True" if a < b else "is False"
```
<br>

#### Function Structure
To create a function you must specify the `def` keyword followed by the `name` of the function and then brackets `()` or with arguments `(x)`. You can also specify default value for an argument `(a=3)`.

``` python
# prints out a + b
def add(a, b):
  print(a + b)
```
<br>

#### Objects
You need a class before you can instantiate and object. Every class will have an `init` method which is called each time you create an object for that class.

``` python
# create person class
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name="John Smith"):
    self.name = name

  def getName(self):
    return self.name

# create a person object    
pratik = Person()
pratik = Person("Pratik Shah")
print(pratik.getName())
```
<br>

### Variables, Objects & Values <a name="var-obj-val"></a>
Everything in Python 3 is an object so it contains an ID, Type and Value.

</figure>

<br>

#### Mutable or Immutable
Some object can in Python can change their values which would render them as mutable. If they cannot then they are immutable. You can tell if and object is immutable or not by looking to see if it's ID has changed.

Immutable - numbers, strings, tuples.

Mutable - lists, dictionaries, and other objects depending on how they are implemented.

<br>

#### Numbers
There are two types of numbers: integers and floats. When you divide the return value is a float unless you round by using // or use round(expression, rounding_digits).

You can also get the remainder of a number by using `%` modulus. If you want to convert floating point to integer you can typecast by using `int(x)` or vice versa `float(x)`.

<br>

#### Strings
Strings are immutable objects that can be created using single or double quotes `'string'` or `"string"`. You can also use escape characters within a string. If you want the string on one line you place an `r` before the string; `r"this is a raw string"`. This is good for regular expressions.

You can also do string interpolation with variables by using the `{}` along with the `.format(var)` method.

#### Lists and Tuples (arrays)
Tuples are like lists except they are an immutable object which cannot be changed. They are created by using `()` ex: `tup = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`. Good for a fixed list of data.

Lists aka arrays are mutable and you can add and delete data. They are created by using the `[]` ex: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

<br>

#### Dictionaries (hash)
Dictionaries are like hashes which contain key value pairs. They are created by `h = { 'key': 'value' }`.

<br>

#### Boolean
A boolean object has the value of either `True` or `False`. They are immutable objects so values that are true will always have same id and vice versa if they are false.

``` python
x, y = 5, 15

x == y  # will return false
x > y   # will return false
x < y   # will return true

# you can specify true false directly
t = true
```

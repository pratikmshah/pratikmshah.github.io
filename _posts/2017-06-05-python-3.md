Python is a programming language which has gained quite attraction for people working with data; especially in the finance industry.  One reason why is its vast amounts of open source libraries for data manipulation and analysis such as Pandas, NumPy and TensorFlow. Python is also very strict in syntax so you are almost guaranteed to have neat code because if you are missing even one space your editor will complain.

### Requirements?

You will need to install a version of Python 3 from the installer found [here](https://www.python.org/). You will also need to a text editor and two popular ones as of this time are [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/). and [atom](http://atom.io/). Once those are installed you are ready to begin.

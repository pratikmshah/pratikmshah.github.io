Python is a programming language which has gained quite attraction for people working with data; especially in the finance industry.  One reason why is its vast amounts of open source libraries for data manipulation and analysis such as Pandas, NumPy and TensorFlow. Python is also very strict in syntax so you are almost guaranteed to have neat code because if you are missing even one space your editor will complain.

### Requirements? <a name="requirements"></a>

You will need to install a version of Python 3 from the installer found [here](https://www.python.org/). You will also need to a text editor and two popular ones as of this time are [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/). and [atom](http://atom.io/). Once those are installed you are ready to begin.

<br>

### Syntax <a name="syntax"></a>

#### Main

The main function is used so that functions can be invoked no matter where the function is defined. We need an if statement to insure that the main function gets called if one exists in the script.

``` python
#!/usr/bin/python3
# auto exec main function if exists

def main():
  print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__": main()

```
<br>

#### Whitespace
The whitespace tell the compiler that the statements are associated with the preceding function or conditional. Traditionally there are 4 spaces for indentation. There are no character braces ({}) like there are in other languages to specify a block.

``` python
# this is correct
def main():
  print("Hello World!")
  print("Line 2")

# if you have one line to exec you can put all on one line
# you can put spaces after :
def main():print("This will work")

#....
if __name__ == "__main__": main()

```
<br>

#### Comments
To comment use the `#` symbol for one line comments. Other languages have multi line comments; however, in python they should be avoided.

``` python
# this is a comment
```
<br>

#### Assignment
Assigning values is just like other languages by using the `=` operator. You also don't need to specify the type of variable being created; like in ruby.

You can see the class of the variable by using the `type(x)` function. Also you can mass assign variable in a single line.

</figure>

<br>

#### Conditionals Structure
The conditionals are similarly structured to how they are in other languages. Use `if`, `elif`, `else` to evaluate statements

``` python
a, b = 1, 2

if a < b:
  print("first statement")
elif a > b:
  print("second statement")
else:
  print("third statement")
```
<br>

You can use ternary operation but instead of `?` and `:` you use `if` and `else`.

``` python
a, b = 1, 2
x = "is True" if a < b else "is False"
```
<br>

#### Function Structure
To create a function you must specify the `def` keyword followed by the `name` of the function and then brackets `()` or with arguments `(x)`. You can also specify default value for an argument `(a=3)`.

``` python
# prints out a + b
def add(a, b):
  print(a + b)
```
<br>

#### Objects
You need a class before you can instantiate and object. Every class will have an `init` method which is called each time you create an object for that class.

``` python
# create person class
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name="John Smith"):
    self.name = name

  def getName(self):
    return self.name

# create a person object    
pratik = Person()
pratik = Person("Pratik Shah")
print(pratik.getName())
```
<br>

### Variables, Objects & Values <a name="var-obj-val"></a>
Everything in Python 3 is an object so it contains an ID, Type and Value.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/objvar.png" class="blg-img" alt="object's value, id and type">
</figure>

<br>

#### Mutable or Immutable
Some object can in Python can change their values which would render them as mutable. If they cannot then they are immutable. You can tell if and object is immutable or not by looking to see if it's ID has changed.

Immutable - numbers, strings, tuples.

Mutable - lists, dictionaries, and other objects depending on how they are implemented.

<br>

#### Numbers
There are two types of numbers: integers and floats. When you divide the return value is a float unless you round by using // or use round(expression, rounding_digits).

You can also get the remainder of a number by using `%` modulus. If you want to convert floating point to integer you can typecast by using `int(x)` or vice versa `float(x)`.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/numbers.png" class="blg-img" alt="numbers">
</figure>

<br>

#### Strings
Strings are immutable objects that can be created using single or double quotes `'string'` or `"string"`. You can also use escape characters within a string. If you want the string on one line you place an `r` before the string; `r"this is a raw string"`. This is good for regular expressions.

You can also do string interpolation with variables by using the `{}` along with the `.format(var)` method.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/strings.png" class="blg-img" alt="strings">
</figure>

<br>

#### Lists and Tuples (arrays)
Tuples are like lists except they are an immutable object which cannot be changed. They are created by using `()` ex: `tup = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`. Good for a fixed list of data.

Lists aka arrays are mutable and you can add and delete data. They are created by using the `[]` ex: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/lists.png" class="blg-img" alt="lists">
</figure>

<br>

#### Dictionaries (hash)
Dictionaries are like hashes which contain key value pairs. They are created by `h = { 'key': 'value' }`.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/dictionary.png" class="blg-img" alt="dictionary">
</figure>

<br>

#### Boolean
A boolean object has the value of either `True` or `False`. They are immutable objects so values that are true will always have same id and vice versa if they are false.

``` python
x, y = 5, 15

x == y  # will return false
x > y   # will return false
x < y   # will return true

# you can specify true false directly
t = true
```

<br>

### Conditionals <a name="conditional"></a>

#### If Elif Else Statements
Use `if` keyword followed by a statement to run a block of code if the statement evaluates to `True`. You can add an `else` statement which executes a block of code in the event that the statement in the if evaluates to `False`

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/if-else.png" class="blg-img" alt="if else">
</figure>

Use `elif` to evaluate multiple set of conditions

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/elif.png" class="blg-img" alt="if elif else">
</figure>

<br>

#### Switch Case
Python does't have a switch case statement but you can combine a dictionary and a simple variable to create something similar.

``` python
# use dictionary to create cases and variable to store choice
# use the get method to get return the value and create a default value if choice does not exist
select = dict(
  one = 1,
  ten = 10,
  hundred = 100,
  thousand = 1000
)
choice = 'hundred'
print(select.get(choice, 'error'))
```

<br>

#### Ternary
``` python
# for simple if else statements condensed into one line
x = True
print("X is true" if x == True else "X is false")
```

<br>

### Loops <a name="loops"></a>

#### While
The `while` loop loops through until the expression evaluates to false. While loop ex: `while x < 15`.

``` python
# fibonacci sequence up to 10
x, y = 0, 1
while y < 10:
  print(y, end=' ')
  x, y = y, x + y
```
<br>

#### For
`for` loops allows you to to iterate through an object's values one by one. For loop ex; `for i in cards`. For introduces the loop, variable i represents each value one by one and cards will be object you are looping through. You can loop through almost any object.

``` python
x = [1, 2, 'text', 4.57]
for i in x:
  print(i, end = '\n')
```
<br>

#### For with Counter (OG style)
You can use the enumerate method to create and index while looping. `for index, line in enumerate(array)`.

``` python
for index, value in enumerate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]):
  print(index, value, end = '\n')
```
<br>

#### Break & Continue
If you want to skip an occurrence in a loop use `continue`. If you want to break out of the loop completely use `break`. Python also has an `else` statement which gets run once the loop condition becomes `False`.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/break-cont.png" class="blg-img" alt="break continue else">
</figure>

<br>

### Operators <a name="operator"></a>

#### Arithmetic
  - `+` add
  - `-` subtract
  - `*` multiply
  - `/` divide
  - `//` divides and floors number
  - `*` returns remainder
  - `divmod(5, 3)` will return both number and remainder
  - `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=` short hand

<br>

#### Comparison
The comparison operators will either return `True` or `False`
  - `<` less than
  - `>` greater than
  - `<=` less than or equal to
  - `>=` greater than or equal to
  - `==` equal to
  - `!=` not equal to
  - `is` and `is not` will compare ids of Objects

<br>

#### Boolean
`True` and `False` are part of boolean class
  - `and` both statments must be true
  - `or` one of the two statements must be true

<br>

#### Container with Slice
You can use slices or ranges to return a specific starting and end point in an object. The last point is non inclusive.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/posts/python3/slice.png" class="blg-img" alt="slice">
</figure>

<br>

#### Operator Precedence
Basic order of operations work when adding, subtracting etc... Use `()` to evaluate a block that you need first. Here is a link to [Python's Order of Operations](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~valerie/courses/fall10/155/resources/op_precedence.html)

<br>

### Regular Expressions <a name="regex"></a>

#### RegEx Module
Regular expressions helps match patterns in text. In Python you use the `re` module to implement regular expressions. The module must be imported first `import re`. To use it you simply use method `re.compile(r'\d')` to create a pattern and `re.search(regex, text)` to search for the pattern within the text.
 - [RegEx Resource](http://regexr.com/)
 - [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

#### Searching & Replacing
To search and replace text use the sub method `sub(search_text, replace_val, text)`.

#### RegEx Compiling
To precompile the regex you will be looking for use the `compile(pattern)` method and set it to a variable ex: `pattern = re.compile('Pratik')`

<br>

### Exceptions <a name="except"></a>
Exceptions are use to handle error control. You can use `try` and `catch` to execute statements and retrieve errors if any. You can create your own exceptions with `raise`

``` python
try:
    file = open("filename")
except IOError as e:
    print(e)
else:
    for l in file:print(l)
```

#### Handling Exceptions
Use `try` and `except` for code that may return errors.

``` python
# this will catch all error
try:
    file = open("errrrror.txt")
except:
    print("File open error")
else:
    for l in file: print(l)

#-----------------------------

# you can also specify a specific error type
except IOError as e:
```

#### Raising Exceptions
You can create your own custom error messages by using `raise`

``` python
# check to see if the filename ends with .doc
if filename.endswith('.doc'):
  fh = open(filename)
else:
  raise FileExtension('Filename must end with .doc')

try:
    file = open("errrrror.txt")
except FileExtension as e:
    print("Bad filename", e)
else:
    for l in file: print(l)
```

<br>

### Functions <a name="function"></a>

#### Defining a Function
To create a function you must first use the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function and parenthesis with optional arguments, if any, ex: `def add(x, y)`. If you would like to create the function signature without any statements you can use the `pass` keyword so that the interpreter will skip over it.

``` python
# run main function on load
def main():
    testfunc()
    add(5, 6)

# function without arguments
def testfunc():
    print("this is a test function")

# function with arguments
def add(x, y):
    print(x + y)

if __name__ == "__main__": main()
```

#### Arguments
If you don't know the number of arguments that may be passed you can pass `*args` which will then give you access to the values through a tuple.

``` python
# function with unknown arguments
def add(*args):
    total = 0
    for i in args:
      total += i
    print(total)

add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

#### Named Functions
Use named arguments `**kwargs` to specify default values and access via dictionary.

``` python
def main():
    numbers(one = 1, ten = 10, hundred = 100)

# function with named arguments
def numbers(**kwargs):
  print(kwargs['one'], kwargs['ten'])

main()
```

#### Return Values from Functions
Use `return` keyword followed by object or variable

``` python
def main():
    numbers()

# function with named arguments
def numbers():
    return range(100)

main()
```

#### Generator Function
The generator function allows you to continue running statements after the `yield` keyword each time it runs until the loop becomes false.

``` python
def main():
    for i in numbers(0, 25, 5):
      print(i, end=' ')

# function with named arguments
def numbers(start, stop, step):
    i = start
    while i <= stop:
      yield i
      i += step

main()
```
<br>

### Classes <a name="classes"></a>

#### Classes and Objects
Classes are how you create your own objects. A class is the blueprint for an object. An object is an instance of a class.

```python
# create human class
class Human:
    def talk(self):
        print('Hello!')

    def run(self):
        print('Zoom zoom!')

# create an instance from Human class        
pratik = Human()
pratik.talk()
pratik.run()
```

#### Methods
Call an attribute of an object by using the `.` operator. The keyword `self` refers to the instance of the object. You can create a constructor method `def __init__(self)` which auto executes when a new instance of the class is created.

``` python
# create human class
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name, age, height):
      self.name = name
      self.age = age
      self.height = height

    def info(self):
        print("My name is {} and I am {} years old and am {} tall".format(self.name, self.age, self.height))

# create an instance from Human class        
pratik = Human("Pratik", "25", "5\'7")
pratik.info()
```

#### Object Data
After creating attributes for an object you can create methods to get and set values of each attribute. A better design would be to take in a hash of values and mass assign it.

``` python
# create human class
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name, age, height):
      self.name = name
      self.age = age
      self.height = height

    def info(self):
        print("My name is {} and I am {} years old and am {} tall".format(self.name, self.age, self.height))

    def get_name(self):
      return self.name

    def set_name(self, name):
      self.name = name

pratik = Human("Pratik", "25", "5\'7")
pratik.info()
print(pratik.get_name())
```

scalability refactoring
``` python
def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    self.variables = kwargs

def set_variable(self, k, v):
    self.variables[k] = v

def get_variable(self, k):
    return self.variables.get(k, None)
```

#### Inheritance
A class can use methods of another class via inheritance. To inherit you simply drop the class as an argument to the inheriting class ex: `def Human(Mammal)`. If you have conflicting method signatures the child will override the parent unless you use the `super().methodName()`.

``` python
# create mammal class
class Mammal:
    def walk(self): print('I walk normally.')
    def talk(self): print('I can speak!')

# human class inherits from Mammal
class Human(Mammal):
    def __init__(self, name, age, height):
      self.name = name
      self.age = age
      self.height = height

    def info(self):
        print("My name is {} and I am {} years old and am {} tall".format(self.name, self.age, self.height))

    def get_name(self):
      return self.name

    def set_name(self, name):
      self.name = name

    # The super().method() will call the parent
    def walk(self):
      super().walk()
      print('Zoom Zoom!')

pratik = Human("Pratik", "25", "5\'7")
pratik.info()
print(pratik.get_name())
pratik.walk()
pratik.talk()
```

#### Polymorphism
Transforms one class as if it was another class. Also known is duck typing. This is good to create one super class to be used by multiple sub classes.

``` python
class Dog:
  def bark(self):
    print('Wooof!')

  def walk(self):
    print('Runs!')

  def fur(self):
    print('Lots of it.')

class Cat:
  def bark(self):
    print('Meeeoooowww!')

  def walk(self):
    print('Slow!')

  def fur(self):
    print('Silky smooth')

bud = Dog()
whisk = Cat()

for obj in (bud, whisk):
  obj.bark()
  obj.walk()
  obj.fur()

# create method where it takes an obj
def dog_or_cat_doesnt_matter(dog):
  dog.bark()
  dog.walk()

# put cat obj inside method for dog obj
dog_or_cat_doesnt_matter(whisk)
```

#### Using Generators
You can create a class that is iterate-able.  You need to specify in the class the method `def __iter__(self)`.

``` python
class inclusive_range:
    def __init__(self, *args):
      numargs = len(args)
      if numargs < 1: raise TypeError('Requires 1 or more arguments')
      elif numargs == 1:
        self.stop = args[0]
        self.start = 0
        self.step = 1
      elif numargs == 2:
        (self.start, self.stop) = args
        self.step = 1
      elif numargs == 3:
        (self.start, self.stop, self.step) = args
      else: raise TypeError('Expected 3 arguments, got {}'.format(numargs))

    # allows class to iterate
    def __iter_(self):
      i = self.start
      while i <= self.stop:
          yield i
          i += self.step
```

#### Decorators
Special functions that return other functions. Using `@property` before a getter or setter method turns it into a decorator. Other decs are `@prop.setter` or `@prop.deleter`. This will give the control to the object and you don't have to call the method each time simply access the property and set a new value.

``` python
@property
def name(self):
    return self.properties.get('name', None)

@name.setter
def name(self, name):
    self.name = name

# you can now do this
pratik = Human()

pratik.name = "Pratik"
```
<br>

### String Methods

#### Object of Type String & Methods
  - `.format(var)` use format method to do string interpolation
  - `.capitalize()` will capitalize the first letter
  - `.upper()` will capitalize all letters
  - `.lower()` will lowercase all letters
  - `.swapcase()` will alter the case of the letter
  - `.find('str')` will return first index of the letter found
  - `.replace('str', 'str2')` replaces and returns a new string (new ID)
  - `.strip()` removes all whitespaces
  - `.rstrip()` removes whitespaces at end of string
  - `.isalnum()` checks to see if all characters are alphanumeric (t/f)
  - `.isalpha()` checks for characters a-z
  - `.isdigit()` checks to see if text are all digits
  - `.isprintable()` checks to see if all characters are printable

#### String Format
``` python
# this will display b twice and a once.
a, b = 12, 4
'this {1} will display {1} {0}'

# you can even use variables and drop in a dictionary in the format
d = dict( pratik = a, john = b)
'my name is {pratik} and he is {john}'.format(**d)
```

#### Split and Join Strings
  - `.split()` will split each word one by one
  - `.split('split text')` will split each time based on "split text"
  - `'join divider'.join(arr_to_join)` will join string and place "join divider" in between each word.

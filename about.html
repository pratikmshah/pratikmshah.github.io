        Hi, I'm <a href="https://about.me/pratikshah" title="one of a million!">Pratik</a> a jr developer or as I like to call it Padawan in training from <a href="https://news.artnet.com/wp-content/news-upload/2014/06/Chicago-Skyline.jpg" target="_blank">Chicago</a>. I used to be a 10-key crunching vlookuping beast of an <a href="http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i39/2/1/28/frabz-Accountant-What-my-friends-think-I-do-What-my-mom-thinks-I-do-Wh-b3c571.jpg" target="_blank">Accountant</a>. But my passion for technology led me to <a href="https://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> where I hope to fulfill my dream by developing software that will help change society; like the <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/mobileapp" target="_blank">Taco Bell</a> app! Another interest I have is investing and analyzing markets which is why I also have a B.S. in Finance; did someone say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology">Fintech?</a> Lighting round: my favorite color you should know by now is #00AEEF (like this background), I love pad thai and pho, and love to <a href="http://www.city-photos.org/_photo/2958259.jpg">site see</a> for thinking/inspiration. Feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">contact me</a> or read my <a href="/">TechCrunchesque blog</a> (You are already on the site.). Ok its just a basic blog but I shows some interesting concepts, tips, tricks, tutorials I have learned; and sometimes random life things. Oh and I love Taco Bell!

        I am a web developer and former accountant. I'm Indian, and live in Chicago enjoying the cities deep dish pizza offerings. Niles has been my home for over 20 years along with the snow and humidity. If I had a choice to visit any place over and over again it would be San Francisco; I just love the scenery and atmosphere of the west coast.

        Growing up I played a ton of video games (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII">FFVII</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid">MGS</a>), followed the <a href="https://www.google.com/finance">markets</a> (T, VZ, MSFT buy and hold 4ever!), and loved technology(AIM was an essential means of communication as well as that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UY7eDRXrs">annoying dial tone</a>). In college I studied Finance and minored in Information Systems; then worked as an accountant for numerous years. Eventually, my passion for how technology helps change the world took over and I decided to make the change before it was too late. I finished an intense 18 week web development bootcamp at Dev Bootcamp(<a href="/projects.html">final project</a>).

      <p>
        I'm glad I made the switch and learned how to code because it gave me the ability to help make a change in the world by contributing to applications that people depend on; whether it is used by hundreds or millions of people. I wake up everyday make the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gainz">gainz</a>, get ready, and then eat, sleep, code, repeat (infinite loop!). Currently, I am working on some applications that I had always wanted to make(see list below) and also diving my brain into a plethora of new technologies. This is just the beginning of a long journey. Always keep learning!
